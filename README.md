## Note for devs coming from `matthew1232/discord-webhook-node`

If you were previously using [matthew1232/discord-webhook-node](https://github.com/matthew1232/discord-webhook-node), **my package changes the API** so it won't be a simple drop-in replacement. **However**, it's very easy to migrate to Hookr, plus you'll get updated packages, better documentation, and a cleaner codebase.

### Other note

My replacement isn't complete yet. I'll update the readme when this repo is ready.

## Installation

```bash
npm i @tycrek/discord-hookr
```

# Docs are coming soon!
